Title: The Gambler
Author: Andy Holloway
Entry: /mnt/d/Proper Photos/photos/ccc competition images/Serial PDI 2024-2025 Round 1/01_036_SerialPDI1_2425.jpg (01_036_SerialPDI1_2425.jpg)
  LAB result: FAIL (not mono) via lab
  Notes: Hue variation stays tight (≈11.5°), consistent with a single tint. Bright regions reach chroma 10.30 and the 99th percentile sits near 9.43, which looks strongly coloured. Around 99.9% of pixels sit beyond C*2 and 60.9% exceed C*4, so the cast touches a noticeable portion of the frame. Largest C*4 cluster covers 60.9% of the frame. Hue stays consistent from shadows to highlights. Two-peak analysis shows Δh=35.7° with secondary mass=6.2%. Highlights and shadows hues are close (Δh=4.5°), indicating a drifted single tone.
  Tones: dominant tone ≈ yellow; other tones: yellow, green
  Reason: Colour variation exceeds the toned limits for this class. Dominant tone around yellow. Highlights and shadows hues are close (Δh=4.5°), indicating a drifted single tone. Strong tint patch exceeds hard limit (pct>C*4 60.9%, largest cluster 60.9%, C*99 9.43).
  Failure tag: color_present
  Lightroom tip: In Develop > Basic, toggle B&W to show how much colour sits on top of the grayscale base. Then drag the Yellow saturation slider in HSL up and down—the yellow cast swings instantly. Zoom into the hotspot highlighted by the overlay; that region holds most of the coloured pixels. Overlay hint: lab_chroma (switch to lab_residual to see hue direction).

Title: See The Truth

  LAB result: PASS_WITH_QUERY (toned) via lab [review]
  Notes: Hue variation spans about 106.2°, so multiple colour families are in play. Bright regions reach chroma 8.60 and the 99th percentile sits near 4.24, which looks clearly coloured. Around 16.6% of pixels sit beyond C*2 and 1.7% exceed C*4, so the cast touches a noticeable portion of the frame. Largest C*4 cluster covers 1.7% of the frame. Hue swings by about 111.9° between darks and lights, so tones respond differently. Two-peak analysis shows Δh=179.1° with secondary mass=27.0%. Highlights and shadows hues are distinct (Δh=165.6°), supporting a split-tone interpretation.
  Tones: dominant tone ≈ magenta; other tones: magenta, aqua, aqua
  Reason: Borderline toned image dominated by magenta; hue variation is close to the review threshold. Overall tint is present but still subtle. Multiple hue clusters detected—confirm the toning is intentional. Hue changes noticeably between darks and lights. Highlights and shadows hues are distinct (Δh=165.6°), supporting a split-tone interpretation.
  Lightroom tip: Press B&W to compare; if the frame barely shifts, the tint is subtle but measurable. Use Color Grading to drop Shadow and Highlight saturation to zero and back—the opposing hues reveal the split tone. Leave it if you like the tone—it's flagged only for review. Overlay hint: lab_residual (add lab_chroma to gauge intensity).

  LAB result: PASS_WITH_QUERY (toned) via lab [review]
  Notes: Hue variation spans about 47.5°, so multiple colour families are in play. Bright regions reach chroma 3.00 and the 99th percentile sits near 2.24, which looks a faint but measurable tint. About 1.1% of pixels nudge past C*2, with 0.0% showing stronger colour (C*4). Largest C*2 cluster covers 1.1% of the frame. Hue stays consistent from shadows to highlights. Two-peak analysis shows Δh=90.1° with secondary mass=38.3%. Highlights and shadows hues are distinct (Δh=88.8°), supporting a split-tone interpretation.
  Tones: dominant tone ≈ blue; other tones: purple, aqua, red
  Reason: Borderline toned image dominated by blue; hue variation is close to the review threshold. Overall tint is essentially nil. Multiple hue clusters detected—confirm the toning is intentional. Highlights and shadows hues are distinct (Δh=88.8°), supporting a split-tone interpretation.

Around 33.3% of pixels sit beyond C*2 and 23.2% exceed C*4, so the cast touches a noticeable portion of the frame. Largest C*4 cluster covers 23.2% of the frame. Hue stays consistent from shadows to highlights. Two-peak analysis shows Δh=80.5° with secondary mass=0.8%. Highlights and shadows hues are close (Δh=18.9°), indicating a drifted single tone.
  Tones: dominant tone ≈ magenta; other tones: magenta, blue, aqua
  Reason: Borderline toned image dominated by magenta; hue variation is close to the review threshold. Overall tint is present but still subtle. Multiple hue clusters detected—confirm the toning is intentional. Highlights and shadows hues are close (Δh=18.9°), indicating a drifted single tone. Large neutral-shadow region (~54.4%) with a single-hue subject—review lighting intent.
  Lightroom tip: Press B&W to compare; if the frame barely shifts, the tint is subtle but measurable. Raise the global Saturation to +40 and return to zero while watching the magenta areas for a gentle swing. Leave it if you like the tone—it's flagged only for review. Overlay hint: lab_chroma (switch to lab_residual to see hue direction).

Title: Tuddenham Evening

Entry: /mnt/d/Proper Photos/photos/ccc competition images/Serial PDI 2024-2025 Round 2/01_002_SerialPDI2_2425.jpg (01_002_SerialPDI2_2425.jpg)
  LAB result: FAIL (not mono) via lab
  Notes: Hue variation spans about 116.3°, so multiple colour families are in play. Bright regions reach chroma 35.36 and the 99th percentile sits near 8.54, which looks strongly coloured. Around 31.4% of pixels sit beyond C*2 and 7.0% exceed C*4, so the cast touches a noticeable portion of the frame. Largest C*4 cluster covers 6.9% of the frame. Hue flips by roughly 160.2° through the tonal range, a strong split-tone signature. Two-peak analysis shows Δh=169.7° with secondary mass=37.3%. Highlights and shadows hues are distinct (Δh=95.5°), supporting a split-tone interpretation.
  Tones: dominant tone ≈ green; other tones: orange, blue, aqua
  Reason: Split-toned image with distinct hue families across the frame. (likely Sepia-Cyanotype) Dominant tone around green. Hue flips between hue families across the tonal range. Highlights and shadows hues are distinct (Δh=95.5°), supporting a split-tone interpretation. Strong tint patch exceeds hard limit (pct>C*4 7.0%, largest cluster 6.9%, C*99 8.54).
  Failure tag: Split-Toning Suspected (likely Sepia-Cyanotype).
  Look: Historic darkroom look with aged highlights and cool, paper-like shadows.
  Lightroom tip: In Develop > Basic, toggle B&W to show how much colour sits on top of the grayscale base. Then drag the Green saturation slider in HSL up and down—the green cast swings instantly. If tones change across the range, pull Shadow and Highlight saturation to zero in Color Grading and restore it to expose the split tone. Zoom into the hotspot highlighted by the overlay; that region holds most of the coloured pixels. Overlay hint: lab_residual (add lab_chroma to gauge intensity).

  LAB result: FAIL (not mono) via lab
  Notes: Hue variation covers about 16.6°; the tint wanders but stays related. Bright regions reach chroma 18.03 and the 99th percentile sits near 16.12, which looks strongly coloured. Around 91.2% of pixels sit beyond C*2 and 83.1% exceed C*4, so the cast touches a noticeable portion of the frame. Largest C*4 cluster covers 83.1% of the frame. Hue stays consistent from shadows to highlights. Two-peak analysis shows Δh=140.4° with secondary mass=1.7%. Highlights and shadows hues are close (Δh=7.5°), indicating a drifted single tone.
  Tones: dominant tone ≈ green; other tones: green, purple, purple
  Reason: Multiple strong colours appear instead of a single tint. Dominant tone around green. Highlights and shadows hues are close (Δh=7.5°), indicating a drifted single tone. Strong tint patch exceeds hard limit (pct>C*4 83.1%, largest cluster 83.1%, C*99 16.12).

  LAB result: PASS_WITH_QUERY (toned) via lab [review]
  Notes: Hue variation spans about 134.3°, so multiple colour families are in play. Bright regions reach chroma 11.05 and the 99th percentile sits near 3.16, which looks clearly coloured. Roughly 4.6% of the frame carries a mild tint (C*2) and 0.5% pushes into stronger colour. Largest C*4 cluster covers 0.5% of the frame. Hue swings by about 71.3° between darks and lights, so tones respond differently. Two-peak analysis shows Δh=32.1° with secondary mass=33.4%. Highlights and shadows hues are distinct (Δh=155.5°), supporting a split-tone interpretation.
  Tones: dominant tone ≈ red; other tones: magenta, red, orange
  Reason: Borderline toned image dominated by red; hue variation is close to the review threshold. Overall tint is essentially nil. Multiple hue clusters detected—confirm the toning is intentional. Hue changes noticeably between darks and lights. Highlights and shadows hues are distinct (Δh=155.5°), supporting a split-tone interpretation.
  Lightroom tip: Press B&W to compare; if the frame barely shifts, the tint is subtle but measurable. Use Color Grading to drop Shadow and Highlight saturation to zero and back—the opposing hues reveal the split tone. Leave it if you like the tone—it's flagged only for review. Overlay hint: lab_residual (add lab_chroma to gauge intensity).

  LAB result: PASS_WITH_QUERY (toned) via lab [review]
  Notes: Hue variation covers about 17.7°; the tint wanders but stays related. Bright regions reach chroma 3.16 and the 99th percentile sits near 2.24, which looks a faint but measurable tint. About 1.8% of pixels nudge past C*2, with 0.0% showing stronger colour (C*4). Largest C*2 cluster covers 0.7% of the frame. Hue stays consistent from shadows to highlights. Two-peak analysis shows Δh=39.8° with secondary mass=22.6%. Highlights and shadows hues are close (Δh=15.8°), indicating a drifted single tone.
  Tones: dominant tone ≈ purple; other tones: purple, purple
  Reason: Borderline toned image dominated by purple; hue variation is close to the review threshold. Overall tint is essentially nil. Multiple hue clusters detected—confirm the toning is intentional. Highlights and shadows hues are close (Δh=15.8°), indicating a drifted single tone. Toning collapsed to a single hue family across highlights and shadows. Hue variation is wider than typical for a pure single tone.
  Lightroom tip: Press B&W to compare; if the frame barely shifts, the tint is subtle but measurable. Raise the global Saturation to +40 and return to zero while watching the purple areas for a gentle swing. Leave it if you like the tone—it's flagged only for review. Overlay hint: lab_chroma (switch to lab_residual to see hue direction).

  Notes: Hue variation spans about 50.8°, so multiple colour families are in play. Bright regions reach chroma 7.07 and the 99th percentile sits near 2.24, which looks a faint but measurable tint. About 1.4% of pixels nudge past C*2, with 0.0% showing stronger colour (C*4). Largest C*4 cluster covers 0.0% of the frame. Hue shifts gently (≈10.3°) across the tonal range. Two-peak analysis shows Δh=49.0° with secondary mass=31.7%. Highlights and shadows hues are close (Δh=26.0°), indicating a drifted single tone.
  Tones: dominant tone ≈ red; other tones: orange, red, yellow
  Reason: Borderline toned image dominated by red; hue variation is close to the review threshold. Overall tint is essentially nil. Multiple hue clusters detected—confirm the toning is intentional. Hue shifts gently as tones brighten. Highlights and shadows hues are close (Δh=26.0°), indicating a drifted single tone. Toning collapsed to a single hue family across highlights and shadows.

  Notes: Hue variation spans about 48.7°, so multiple colour families are in play. Bright regions reach chroma 4.47 and the 99th percentile sits near 1.00, which looks barely above neutral. Only trace pixels (under 0.5%) creep past the C*2 threshold. Largest C*2 cluster covers 0.0% of the frame. Hue shifts gently (≈17.5°) across the tonal range. Two-peak analysis shows Δh=30.3° with secondary mass=17.9%. Highlights and shadows hues are close (Δh=36.4°), indicating a drifted single tone.
  Tones: dominant tone ≈ magenta; other tones: red, magenta, aqua

  LAB result: PASS_WITH_QUERY (toned) via lab [review]
  Notes: Hue variation spans about 118.2°, so multiple colour families are in play. Bright regions reach chroma 4.47 and the 99th percentile sits near 3.16, which looks clearly coloured. Around 28.9% of pixels sit beyond C*2 and 0.1% exceed C*4, so the cast touches a noticeable portion of the frame. Largest C*4 cluster covers 0.1% of the frame. Hue flips by roughly 216.6° through the tonal range, a strong split-tone signature. Two-peak analysis shows Δh=174.3° with secondary mass=41.6%. Highlights and shadows hues are close (Δh=11.7°), indicating a drifted single tone.
  Tones: dominant tone ≈ green; other tones: yellow, purple, magenta
  Reason: Borderline toned image dominated by green; hue variation is close to the review threshold. Overall tint is present but still subtle. Multiple hue clusters detected—confirm the toning is intentional. Hue flips between hue families across the tonal range. Highlights and shadows hues are close (Δh=11.7°), indicating a drifted single tone. Toning collapsed to a single hue family across highlights and shadows. Hue variation is wider than typical for a pure single tone.
  Lightroom tip: Press B&W to compare; if the frame barely shifts, the tint is subtle but measurable. Use Color Grading to drop Shadow and Highlight saturation to zero and back—the opposing hues reveal the split tone. Leave it if you like the tone—it's flagged only for review. Overlay hint: lab_residual (add lab_chroma to gauge intensity).

Title: Zebra
Author: Ken Bingham
Entry: /mnt/d/Proper Photos/photos/ccc competition images/Serial PDI 2025-2026 Round 1/01_006_SerialPDI1_2526.jpg (01_006_SerialPDI1_2526.jpg)
  LAB result: PASS_WITH_QUERY (toned) via lab [review]
  Notes: Hue variation covers about 14.6°; the tint wanders but stays related. Bright regions reach chroma 11.05 and the 99th percentile sits near 7.07, which looks strongly coloured. Roughly 8.9% of the frame carries a mild tint (C*2) and 4.9% pushes into stronger colour. Largest C*4 cluster covers 4.9% of the frame. Hue stays consistent from shadows to highlights. Two-peak analysis shows Δh=59.6° with secondary mass=1.0%. Highlights and shadows hues are close (Δh=11.8°), indicating a drifted single tone.
  Tones: dominant tone ≈ green; other tones: green, aqua, red
  Reason: Borderline toned image dominated by green; hue variation is close to the review threshold. Overall tint is essentially nil. Multiple hue clusters detected—confirm the toning is intentional. Highlights and shadows hues are close (Δh=11.8°), indicating a drifted single tone.
  Lightroom tip: Press B&W to compare; if the frame barely shifts, the tint is subtle but measurable. Raise the global Saturation to +40 and return to zero while watching the green areas for a gentle swing. Leave it if you like the tone—it's flagged only for review. Overlay hint: lab_chroma (switch to lab_residual to see hue direction).

  LAB result: PASS_WITH_QUERY (toned) via lab [review]
  Notes: Hue variation spans about 88.7°, so multiple colour families are in play. Bright regions reach chroma 22.47 and the 99th percentile sits near 7.28, which looks strongly coloured. Around 15.6% of pixels sit beyond C*2 and 4.6% exceed C*4, so the cast touches a noticeable portion of the frame. Largest C*4 cluster covers 4.5% of the frame. Hue flips by roughly -166.8° through the tonal range, a strong split-tone signature. Two-peak analysis shows Δh=43.4° with secondary mass=26.0%. Highlights and shadows hues are close (Δh=13.4°), indicating a drifted single tone.
  Tones: dominant tone ≈ aqua; other tones: aqua, blue, orange
  Reason: Borderline toned image dominated by aqua; hue variation is close to the review threshold. Overall tint is essentially nil. Multiple hue clusters detected—confirm the toning is intentional. Hue flips between hue families across the tonal range. Highlights and shadows hues are close (Δh=13.4°), indicating a drifted single tone. ICC profile missing; assumed sRGB. Toning collapsed to a single hue family across highlights and shadows. Hue variation is wider than typical for a pure single tone.
  Lightroom tip: Press B&W to compare; if the frame barely shifts, the tint is subtle but measurable. Use Color Grading to drop Shadow and Highlight saturation to zero and back—the opposing hues reveal the split tone. Leave it if you like the tone—it's flagged only for review. Overlay hint: lab_residual (add lab_chroma to gauge intensity).

  LAB result: PASS (toned) via lab [review]
  Notes: Hue variation spans about 110.6°, so multiple colour families are in play. Bright regions reach chroma 7.21 and the 99th percentile sits near 2.24, which looks a faint but measurable tint. Roughly 4.0% of the frame carries a mild tint (C*2) and 0.1% pushes into stronger colour. Largest C*4 cluster covers 0.1% of the frame. Hue flips by roughly 304.7° through the tonal range, a strong split-tone signature. Two-peak analysis shows Δh=179.5° with secondary mass=33.5%. Highlights and shadows hues are distinct (Δh=175.9°), supporting a split-tone interpretation.
  Tones: dominant tone ≈ aqua; other tones: aqua, red, aqua
  Reason: Toned monochrome with a dominant aqua tint; hue variation is narrow but stronger than the standard toned limit. Overall tint is essentially nil. Multiple hue clusters detected—confirm the toning is intentional. Hue flips between hue families across the tonal range. Highlights and shadows hues are distinct (Δh=175.9°), supporting a split-tone interpretation.

Title: No Surrender

Entry: /mnt/d/Proper Photos/photos/ccc competition images/Serial Print 2024-2025 Round 1/01_049_SerialPrint1_2425.jpg (01_049_SerialPrint1_2425.jpg)
  LAB result: FAIL (not mono) via lab
  Notes: Hue variation covers about 13.2°; the tint wanders but stays related. Bright regions reach chroma 34.71 and the 99th percentile sits near 9.49, which looks strongly coloured. Around 88.7% of pixels sit beyond C*2 and 71.6% exceed C*4, so the cast touches a noticeable portion of the frame. Largest C*4 cluster covers 71.6% of the frame. Hue shifts gently (≈37.5°) across the tonal range. Two-peak analysis shows Δh=117.1° with secondary mass=0.3%. Highlights and shadows hues are close (Δh=4.7°), indicating a drifted single tone.
  Tones: dominant tone ≈ green; other tones: green, red, blue
  Reason: Colour variation exceeds the toned limits for this class. Dominant tone around green. Hue shifts gently as tones brighten. Highlights and shadows hues are close (Δh=4.7°), indicating a drifted single tone. Strong tint patch exceeds hard limit (pct>C*4 71.6%, largest cluster 71.6%, C*99 9.49).
  Failure tag: color_present
  Lightroom tip: In Develop > Basic, toggle B&W to show how much colour sits on top of the grayscale base. Then drag the Green saturation slider in HSL up and down—the green cast swings instantly. Zoom into the hotspot highlighted by the overlay; that region holds most of the coloured pixels. Overlay hint: lab_chroma (switch to lab_residual to see hue direction).

  LAB result: PASS_WITH_QUERY (toned) via lab [review]
  Notes: Hue variation spans about 63.7°, so multiple colour families are in play. Bright regions reach chroma 11.18 and the 99th percentile sits near 3.00, which looks clearly coloured. Roughly 4.2% of the frame carries a mild tint (C*2) and 0.3% pushes into stronger colour. Largest C*4 cluster covers 0.2% of the frame. Hue flips by roughly -126.9° through the tonal range, a strong split-tone signature. Two-peak analysis shows Δh=28.1° with secondary mass=28.9%. Highlights and shadows hues are close (Δh=31.4°), indicating a drifted single tone.
  Tones: dominant tone ≈ blue; other tones: aqua, blue, aqua
  Reason: Borderline toned image dominated by blue; hue variation is close to the review threshold. Overall tint is essentially nil. Multiple hue clusters detected—confirm the toning is intentional. Hue flips between hue families across the tonal range. Highlights and shadows hues are close (Δh=31.4°), indicating a drifted single tone. ICC profile missing; assumed sRGB. Toning collapsed to a single hue family across highlights and shadows. Hue variation is wider than typical for a pure single tone.
  Lightroom tip: Press B&W to compare; if the frame barely shifts, the tint is subtle but measurable. Use Color Grading to drop Shadow and Highlight saturation to zero and back—the opposing hues reveal the split tone. Leave it if you like the tone—it's flagged only for review. Overlay hint: lab_residual (add lab_chroma to gauge intensity).

  LAB result: PASS_WITH_QUERY (toned) via lab [review]
  Notes: Hue variation spans about 81.5°, so multiple colour families are in play. Bright regions reach chroma 30.41 and the 99th percentile sits near 6.40, which looks strongly coloured. Around 10.7% of pixels sit beyond C*2 and 3.7% exceed C*4, so the cast touches a noticeable portion of the frame. Largest C*4 cluster covers 3.7% of the frame. Hue flips by roughly -241.1° through the tonal range, a strong split-tone signature. Two-peak analysis shows Δh=45.1° with secondary mass=26.1%. Highlights and shadows hues are distinct (Δh=50.5°), supporting a split-tone interpretation.
  Tones: dominant tone ≈ green; other tones: aqua, yellow, red
  Reason: Borderline toned image dominated by green; hue variation is close to the review threshold. Overall tint is essentially nil. Multiple hue clusters detected—confirm the toning is intentional. Hue flips between hue families across the tonal range. Highlights and shadows hues are distinct (Δh=50.5°), supporting a split-tone interpretation.
  Lightroom tip: Press B&W to compare; if the frame barely shifts, the tint is subtle but measurable. Use Color Grading to drop Shadow and Highlight saturation to zero and back—the opposing hues reveal the split tone. Leave it if you like the tone—it's flagged only for review. Overlay hint: lab_residual (add lab_chroma to gauge intensity).

  Notes: Hue variation spans about 70.7°, so multiple colour families are in play. Bright regions reach chroma 17.69 and the 99th percentile sits near 3.61, which looks clearly coloured. Roughly 7.6% of the frame carries a mild tint (C*2) and 0.8% pushes into stronger colour. Largest C*4 cluster covers 0.8% of the frame. Hue flips by roughly -129.5° through the tonal range, a strong split-tone signature. Two-peak analysis shows Δh=28.4° with secondary mass=25.5%. Highlights and shadows hues are close (Δh=35.1°), indicating a drifted single tone.
  Tones: dominant tone ≈ aqua; other tones: aqua, aqua, purple
  Reason: Borderline toned image dominated by aqua; hue variation is close to the review threshold. Overall tint is present but still subtle. Multiple hue clusters detected—confirm the toning is intentional. Hue flips between hue families across the tonal range. Highlights and shadows hues are close (Δh=35.1°), indicating a drifted single tone. Toning collapsed to a single hue family across highlights and shadows. Hue variation is wider than typical for a pure single tone.
  Lightroom tip: Press B&W to compare; if the frame barely shifts, the tint is subtle but measurable. Use Color Grading to drop Shadow and Highlight saturation to zero and back—the opposing hues reveal the split tone. Leave it if you like the tone—it's flagged only for review.

  LAB result: PASS (toned) via lab [review]
  Notes: Hue variation covers about 23.3°; the tint wanders but stays related. Bright regions reach chroma 7.21 and the 99th percentile sits near 3.61, which looks clearly coloured. Roughly 9.5% of the frame carries a mild tint (C*2) and 0.2% pushes into stronger colour. Largest C*4 cluster covers 0.1% of the frame. Hue stays consistent from shadows to highlights. Two-peak analysis shows Δh=71.5° with secondary mass=8.5%. Highlights and shadows hues are close (Δh=8.2°), indicating a drifted single tone.
  Tones: dominant tone ≈ magenta; other tones: magenta, orange, aqua
  Reason: Toned monochrome with a dominant magenta tint; hue variation is narrow but stronger than the standard toned limit. Overall tint is essentially nil. Multiple hue clusters detected—confirm the toning is intentional. Highlights and shadows hues are close (Δh=8.2°), indicating a drifted single tone.

  LAB result: FAIL (not mono) via lab
  Notes: Hue variation spans about 51.0°, so multiple colour families are in play. Bright regions reach chroma 18.44 and the 99th percentile sits near 6.40, which looks strongly coloured. Around 61.7% of pixels sit beyond C*2 and 14.3% exceed C*4, so the cast touches a noticeable portion of the frame. Largest C*4 cluster covers 14.3% of the frame. Hue flips by roughly -221.9° through the tonal range, a strong split-tone signature. Two-peak analysis shows Δh=83.1° with secondary mass=22.5%. Highlights and shadows hues are distinct (Δh=72.0°), supporting a split-tone interpretation.
  Tones: dominant tone ≈ green; other tones: aqua, yellow, red
  Reason: Split-toned image with distinct hue families across the frame. (likely aqua-yellow Split) Dominant tone around green. Hue flips between hue families across the tonal range. Highlights and shadows hues are distinct (Δh=72.0°), supporting a split-tone interpretation. Strong tint patch exceeds hard limit (pct>C*4 14.3%, largest cluster 14.3%, C*99 6.40).
  Failure tag: Split-Toning Suspected (likely aqua-yellow Split).
  Lightroom tip: In Develop > Basic, toggle B&W to show how much colour sits on top of the grayscale base. Then drag the Green saturation slider in HSL up and down—the green cast swings instantly. If tones change across the range, pull Shadow and Highlight saturation to zero in Color Grading and restore it to expose the split tone. Zoom into the hotspot highlighted by the overlay; that region holds most of the coloured pixels. Overlay hint: lab_residual (add lab_chroma to gauge intensity).

  LAB result: PASS_WITH_QUERY (toned) via lab [review]
  Notes: Hue variation spans about 142.4°, so multiple colour families are in play. Bright regions reach chroma 28.46 and the 99th percentile sits near 5.10, which looks clearly coloured. Roughly 7.4% of the frame carries a mild tint (C*2) and 2.1% pushes into stronger colour. Largest C*4 cluster covers 1.3% of the frame. Hue swings by about 45.1° between darks and lights, so tones respond differently. Two-peak analysis shows Δh=167.4° with secondary mass=42.6%. Highlights and shadows hues are distinct (Δh=178.9°), supporting a split-tone interpretation.
  Tones: dominant tone ≈ yellow; other tones: red, aqua, blue
  Reason: Borderline toned image dominated by yellow; hue variation is close to the review threshold. Overall tint is present but still subtle. Multiple hue clusters detected—confirm the toning is intentional. Hue changes noticeably between darks and lights. Highlights and shadows hues are distinct (Δh=178.9°), supporting a split-tone interpretation.
  Lightroom tip: Press B&W to compare; if the frame barely shifts, the tint is subtle but measurable. Use Color Grading to drop Shadow and Highlight saturation to zero and back—the opposing hues reveal the split tone. Leave it if you like the tone—it's flagged only for review. Overlay hint: lab_residual (add lab_chroma to gauge intensity).

  LAB result: PASS (neutral) via lab
  Notes: Hue variation covers about 18.7°; the tint wanders but stays related. Bright regions reach chroma 4.47 and the 99th percentile sits near 1.00, which looks barely above neutral. Only trace pixels (under 0.5%) creep past the C*2 threshold. Largest C*2 cluster covers 0.2% of the frame. Hue stays consistent from shadows to highlights. Two-peak analysis shows Δh=179.7° with secondary mass=2.6%. Highlights and shadows hues are close (Δh=0.0°), indicating a drifted single tone.
  Tones: dominant tone ≈ red; other tones: red, aqua
  Reason: Neutral monochrome detected; residual chroma sits inside tolerance. Highlights and shadows hues are close (Δh=0.0°), indicating a drifted single tone.

  LAB result: PASS (toned) via lab
  Notes: Hue variation stays tight (≈5.5°), consistent with a single tint. Bright regions reach chroma 15.30 and the 99th percentile sits near 13.15, which looks strongly coloured. Around 100.0% of pixels sit beyond C*2 and 99.8% exceed C*4, so the cast touches a noticeable portion of the frame. Largest C*4 cluster covers 99.8% of the frame. Hue stays consistent from shadows to highlights. Highlights and shadows hues are close (Δh=12.2°), indicating a drifted single tone.
  Tones: dominant tone ≈ green; other tones: green
  Reason: Toned monochrome with a dominant green tint; hue variation stays within the relaxed limit. Overall tint strength is obvious across the frame. Highlights and shadows hues are close (Δh=12.2°), indicating a drifted single tone.
