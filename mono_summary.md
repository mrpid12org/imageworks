  LAB result: FAIL (not mono) via lab
  Notes: Hue variation covers about 20.4°; the tint wanders but stays related. Bright regions reach chroma 8.60 and the 99th percentile sits near 6.71, which looks strongly coloured. Around 98.3% of pixels sit beyond C*2 and 93.8% exceed C*4, so the cast touches a noticeable portion of the frame. Largest C*4 cluster covers 93.8% of the frame. Hue stays consistent from shadows to highlights. Two-peak analysis shows Δh=37.0° with secondary mass=20.1%. Highlights and shadows hues are distinct (Δh=52.3°), supporting a split-tone interpretation.
  Tones: dominant tone ≈ red; other tones: red, red
  Reason: Split-toned image with distinct hue families across the frame. (likely red-red Split) Dominant tone around red. Highlights and shadows hues are distinct (Δh=52.3°), supporting a split-tone interpretation. Strong tint patch exceeds hard limit (pct>C*4 93.8%, largest cluster 93.8%, C*99 6.71).
  Failure tag: Split-Toning Suspected (likely red-red Split).
  Lightroom tip: In Develop > Basic, toggle B&W to show how much colour sits on top of the grayscale base. Then drag the Red saturation slider in HSL up and down—the red cast swings instantly. If tones change across the range, pull Shadow and Highlight saturation to zero in Color Grading and restore it to expose the split tone. Zoom into the hotspot highlighted by the overlay; that region holds most of the coloured pixels. Overlay hint: lab_residual (add lab_chroma to gauge intensity).

  LAB result: PASS_WITH_QUERY (toned) via lab [review]
  Notes: Hue variation stays tight (≈11.8°), consistent with a single tint. Bright regions reach chroma 5.00 and the 99th percentile sits near 3.61, which looks clearly coloured. Around 27.5% of pixels sit beyond C*2 and 0.0% exceed C*4, so the cast touches a noticeable portion of the frame. Largest C*2 cluster covers 26.2% of the frame. Hue stays consistent from shadows to highlights. Two-peak analysis shows Δh=54.1° with secondary mass=3.8%. Highlights and shadows hues are close (Δh=11.8°), indicating a drifted single tone.
  Tones: dominant tone ≈ magenta; other tones: magenta, purple, aqua
  Reason: Borderline toned image dominated by magenta; hue variation is close to the review threshold. Overall tint strength is obvious across the frame. Multiple hue clusters detected—confirm the toning is intentional. Highlights and shadows hues are close (Δh=11.8°), indicating a drifted single tone.
  Lightroom tip: Press B&W to compare; if the frame barely shifts, the tint is subtle but measurable. Raise the global Saturation to +40 and return to zero while watching the magenta areas for a gentle swing. Leave it if you like the tone—it's flagged only for review. Overlay hint: lab_chroma (switch to lab_residual to see hue direction).

  LAB result: PASS (neutral) via lab
  Notes: Hue variation stays tight (≈-0.0°), consistent with a single tint. The 99th percentile chroma is 0.00, which looks barely above neutral.
  Tones: dominant tone ≈ red
  Reason: Neutral monochrome detected; residual chroma sits inside tolerance.

  LAB result: PASS (toned) via lab
  Notes: Hue variation stays tight (≈6.2°), consistent with a single tint. Bright regions reach chroma 11.05 and the 99th percentile sits near 10.00, which looks strongly coloured. Around 97.6% of pixels sit beyond C*2 and 89.9% exceed C*4, so the cast touches a noticeable portion of the frame. Largest C*4 cluster covers 89.9% of the frame. Hue stays consistent from shadows to highlights. Highlights and shadows hues are close (Δh=10.6°), indicating a drifted single tone.
  Tones: dominant tone ≈ green; other tones: green
  Reason: Toned monochrome with a dominant green tint; hue variation stays within the relaxed limit. Overall tint strength is obvious across the frame. Highlights and shadows hues are close (Δh=10.6°), indicating a drifted single tone.
