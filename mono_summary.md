  LAB result: PASS_WITH_QUERY (toned) via lab [review]
  Notes: Hue variation stays tight (≈11.8°), consistent with a single tint. Bright regions reach chroma 5.00 and the 99th percentile sits near 3.61, which looks clearly coloured. Around 27.5% of pixels sit beyond C*2 and 0.0% exceed C*4, so the cast touches a noticeable portion of the frame. Largest C*2 cluster covers 26.2% of the frame. Hue stays consistent from shadows to highlights. Two-peak analysis shows Δh=54.1° with secondary mass=3.8%. Highlights and shadows hues are close (Δh=0.0°), indicating a drifted single tone.
  Tones: dominant tone ≈ magenta; other tones: magenta, purple, aqua
  Reason: Borderline toned image dominated by magenta; hue variation is close to the review threshold. Overall tint strength is obvious across the frame. Multiple hue clusters detected—confirm the toning is intentional. Highlights and shadows hues are close (Δh=0.0°), indicating a drifted single tone.
  Lightroom tip: Press B&W to compare; if the frame barely shifts, the tint is subtle but measurable. Raise the global Saturation to +40 and return to zero while watching the magenta areas for a gentle swing. Leave it if you like the tone—it's flagged only for review. Overlay hint: lab_chroma (switch to lab_residual to see hue direction).

  LAB result: PASS_WITH_QUERY (toned) via lab [review]
  Notes: Hue variation covers about 20.4°; the tint wanders but stays related. Bright regions reach chroma 8.60 and the 99th percentile sits near 6.71, which looks strongly coloured. Around 98.3% of pixels sit beyond C*2 and 93.8% exceed C*4, so the cast touches a noticeable portion of the frame. Largest C*4 cluster covers 93.8% of the frame. Hue stays consistent from shadows to highlights. Two-peak analysis shows Δh=37.0° with secondary mass=20.1%. Highlights and shadows hues are close (Δh=0.0°), indicating a drifted single tone.
  Tones: dominant tone ≈ red; other tones: red, red
  Reason: Borderline toned image dominated by red; hue variation is close to the review threshold. Overall tint strength is obvious across the frame. Multiple hue clusters detected—confirm the toning is intentional. Highlights and shadows hues are close (Δh=0.0°), indicating a drifted single tone. Toning collapsed to a single hue family across highlights and shadows. Hue variation is wider than typical for a pure single tone.
  Lightroom tip: Press B&W to compare; if the frame barely shifts, the tint is subtle but measurable. Raise the global Saturation to +40 and return to zero while watching the red areas for a gentle swing. Leave it if you like the tone—it's flagged only for review. Overlay hint: lab_chroma (switch to lab_residual to see hue direction).
