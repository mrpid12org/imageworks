=== FAIL (1) ===
Title: Dawn Landing - Juvenile Marsh Harrier
Author: André Neves
Entry: 01_022 (01_022_SerialPDI2_2425.jpg)
  LAB result: FAIL (not mono) via lab
  Notes: Hue variation covers about 16.6°; the tint wanders but stays related. Bright regions reach chroma 18.03 and the 99th percentile sits near 16.12, which looks strongly coloured. Around 91.2% of pixels sit beyond C*2 and 83.1% exceed C*4, so the cast touches a noticeable portion of the frame. Largest C*4 cluster covers 83.1% of the frame. Hue stays consistent from shadows to highlights.
  Tones: dominant tone ≈ green; other tones: green, purple, purple
  Reason: Multiple strong colours appear instead of a single tint. Dominant tone around green. Strong tint patch exceeds hard limit (pct>C*4 83.1%, largest cluster 83.1%, C*99 16.12).
  Failure tag: multi_color
  Lightroom tip: In Develop > Basic, toggle B&W to show how much colour sits on top of the grayscale base. Then drag the Green saturation slider in HSL up and down—the green cast swings instantly. Zoom into the hotspot highlighted by the overlay; that region holds most of the coloured pixels. Overlay hint: lab_chroma (switch to lab_residual to see hue direction).


=== QUERY (3) ===
Title: Tuddenham Evening
Author: John Harvey
Entry: 01_002 (01_002_SerialPDI2_2425.jpg)
  LAB result: PASS_WITH_QUERY (toned) via lab [review]
  Notes: Hue variation spans about 116.3°, so multiple colour families are in play. Bright regions reach chroma 35.36 and the 99th percentile sits near 8.54, which looks strongly coloured. Around 31.4% of pixels sit beyond C*2 and 7.0% exceed C*4, so the cast touches a noticeable portion of the frame. Largest C*4 cluster covers 6.9% of the frame. Hue flips by roughly 160.2° through the tonal range, a strong split-tone signature.
  Tones: dominant tone ≈ green; other tones: orange, blue, aqua
  Reason: Borderline toned image dominated by green; hue variation is close to the review threshold. Overall tint is present but still subtle. Multiple hue clusters detected—confirm the toning is intentional. Hue flips between hue families across the tonal range.
  Lightroom tip: Press B&W to compare; if the frame barely shifts, the tint is subtle but measurable. Use Color Grading to drop Shadow and Highlight saturation to zero and back—the opposing hues reveal the split tone. Leave it if you like the tone—it's flagged only for review. Overlay hint: lab_residual (add lab_chroma to gauge intensity).

Title: Follow me
Author: Alan Linsdell
Entry: 01_030 (01_030_SerialPDI2_2425.jpg)
  LAB result: PASS_WITH_QUERY (toned) via lab [review]
  Notes: Hue variation spans about 134.3°, so multiple colour families are in play. Bright regions reach chroma 11.05 and the 99th percentile sits near 3.16, which looks clearly coloured. Roughly 4.6% of the frame carries a mild tint (C*2) and 0.5% pushes into stronger colour. Largest C*4 cluster covers 0.5% of the frame. Hue swings by about 71.3° between darks and lights, so tones respond differently.
  Tones: dominant tone ≈ red; other tones: magenta, red, orange
  Reason: Borderline toned image dominated by red; hue variation is close to the review threshold. Overall tint is essentially nil. Multiple hue clusters detected—confirm the toning is intentional. Hue changes noticeably between darks and lights.

Entry: 01_055 (01_055_SerialPDI2_2425.jpg)
  LAB result: PASS_WITH_QUERY (toned) via lab [review]
  Notes: Hue variation spans about 50.8°, so multiple colour families are in play. Bright regions reach chroma 7.07 and the 99th percentile sits near 2.24, which looks a faint but measurable tint. About 1.4% of pixels nudge past C*2, with 0.0% showing stronger colour (C*4). Largest C*4 cluster covers 0.0% of the frame. Hue shifts gently (≈10.3°) across the tonal range.
  Tones: dominant tone ≈ red; other tones: orange, red, yellow
  Reason: Borderline toned image dominated by red; hue variation is close to the review threshold. Overall tint is essentially nil. Multiple hue clusters detected—confirm the toning is intentional. Hue shifts gently as tones brighten.
