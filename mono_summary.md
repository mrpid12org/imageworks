Title: And now I've got toothache
Author: Brian Cockley
Entry: 01_008_SerialPDI1_2526.jpg (01_008_SerialPDI1_2526.jpg)
  LAB result: PASS_WITH_QUERY (toned) via lab [review]
  Notes: Hue variation spans about 88.7°, so multiple colour families are in play. Bright regions reach chroma 22.47 and the 99th percentile sits near 7.28, which looks strongly coloured. Around 15.6% of pixels sit beyond C*2 and 4.6% exceed C*4, so the cast touches a noticeable portion of the frame. Largest C*4 cluster covers 4.5% of the frame. Hue flips by roughly -166.8° through the tonal range, a strong split-tone signature. Two-peak analysis shows Δh=43.4° with secondary mass=26.0%. Highlights and shadows hues are close (Δh=13.4°), indicating a drifted single tone.
  Tones: dominant tone ≈ aqua; other tones: aqua, blue, orange
  Reason: Borderline toned image dominated by aqua; hue variation is close to the review threshold. Overall tint is essentially nil. Multiple hue clusters detected—confirm the toning is intentional. Hue flips between hue families across the tonal range. Highlights and shadows hues are close (Δh=13.4°), indicating a drifted single tone. ICC profile missing; assumed sRGB. Toning collapsed to a single hue family across highlights and shadows. Hue variation is wider than typical for a pure single tone.
  Lightroom tip: Press B&W to compare; if the frame barely shifts, the tint is subtle but measurable. Use Color Grading to drop Shadow and Highlight saturation to zero and back—the opposing hues reveal the split tone. Leave it if you like the tone—it's flagged only for review. Overlay hint: lab_residual (add lab_chroma to gauge intensity).

Title: Tulip.   'Orange Princess'
Author: Allan Hale
Entry: 01_002_SerialPrint3_2425.jpg (01_002_SerialPrint3_2425.jpg)
  LAB result: PASS (toned) via lab
  Notes: Hue variation stays tight (≈4.4°), consistent with a single tint. Bright regions reach chroma 30.41 and the 99th percentile sits near 29.07, which looks strongly coloured. Around 100.0% of pixels sit beyond C*2 and 99.9% exceed C*4, so the cast touches a noticeable portion of the frame. Largest C*4 cluster covers 99.9% of the frame. Hue stays consistent from shadows to highlights. Highlights and shadows hues are close (Δh=9.8°), indicating a drifted single tone.
  Tones: dominant tone ≈ orange; other tones: orange
  Reason: Toned monochrome with a dominant orange tint; hue variation stays within the relaxed limit. Overall tint strength is obvious across the frame. Highlights and shadows hues are close (Δh=9.8°), indicating a drifted single tone.

Title: Balance
Author: André Neves

  LAB result: PASS (toned) via lab
  Notes: Hue variation stays tight (≈2.2°), consistent with a single tint. Bright regions reach chroma 11.05 and the 99th percentile sits near 9.06, which looks strongly coloured. Around 98.8% of pixels sit beyond C*2 and 97.2% exceed C*4, so the cast touches a noticeable portion of the frame. Largest C*4 cluster covers 97.2% of the frame. Hue stays consistent from shadows to highlights. Highlights and shadows hues are close (Δh=0.0°), indicating a drifted single tone.
  Tones: dominant tone ≈ green; other tones: green
  Reason: Toned monochrome with a dominant green tint; hue variation stays within the relaxed limit. Overall tint strength is obvious across the frame. Highlights and shadows hues are close (Δh=0.0°), indicating a drifted single tone.

Title: Untitled
Author: Fleur Hayles
Entry: 01_045_SerialPDI3_2425.jpg (01_045_SerialPDI3_2425.jpg)
  LAB result: PASS (neutral) via lab [low]
  Notes: Hue variation stays tight (≈0.8°), consistent with a single tint. Bright regions reach chroma 2.24 and the 99th percentile sits near 0.00, which looks barely above neutral. Only trace pixels (under 0.5%) creep past the C*2 threshold. Highlights and shadows hues are close (Δh=0.0°), indicating a drifted single tone.
  Tones: dominant tone ≈ aqua; other tones: aqua
  Reason: Neutral monochrome detected; residual chroma sits inside tolerance. Highlights and shadows hues are close (Δh=0.0°), indicating a drifted single tone. ICC profile missing; assumed sRGB.
