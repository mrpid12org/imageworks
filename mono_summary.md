=== FAIL (1) ===
Title: The Gambler
Author: Andy Holloway
Entry: 01_036 (01_036_SerialPDI1_2425.jpg)
  LAB result: FAIL (not mono) via lab
  Notes: Hue variation covers about 13.6°; the tint wanders but stays related. Bright regions reach chroma 10.30 and the 99th percentile sits near 9.43, which looks strongly coloured. Around 99.9% of pixels sit beyond C*2 and 60.9% exceed C*4, so the cast touches a noticeable portion of the frame. Largest C*4 cluster covers 60.9% of the frame. Hue stays consistent from shadows to highlights.
  Tones: dominant tone ≈ yellow; other tones: yellow, green
  Reason: Colour variation exceeds the toned limits for this class. Dominant tone around yellow. Strong tint patch exceeds hard limit (pct>C*4 60.9%, largest cluster 60.9%, C*99 9.43).
  Failure tag: color_present
  Lightroom tip: In Develop > Basic, toggle B&W to show how much colour sits on top of the grayscale base. Then drag the Yellow saturation slider in HSL up and down—the yellow cast swings instantly. Zoom into the hotspot highlighted by the overlay; that region holds most of the coloured pixels. Overlay hint: lab_chroma (switch to lab_residual to see hue direction).

Title: Vertical Windows
Author: Charles Hall
Entry: 01_011 (01_011_SerialPDI1_2425.jpg)
  LAB result: PASS_WITH_QUERY (toned) via lab [review]
  Notes: Hue variation spans about 49.1°, so multiple colour families are in play. Bright regions reach chroma 3.00 and the 99th percentile sits near 2.24, which looks a faint but measurable tint. About 1.1% of pixels nudge past C*2, with 0.0% showing stronger colour (C*4). Largest C*2 cluster covers 1.1% of the frame. Hue stays consistent from shadows to highlights.
  Tones: dominant tone ≈ blue; other tones: purple, blue, aqua
  Reason: Borderline toned image dominated by blue; hue variation is close to the review threshold. Overall tint is essentially nil. Multiple hue clusters detected—confirm the toning is intentional.
  Lightroom tip: Press B&W to compare; if the frame barely shifts, the tint is subtle but measurable. Use Color Grading to drop Shadow and Highlight saturation to zero and back—the opposing hues reveal the split tone. Leave it if you like the tone—it's flagged only for review. Overlay hint: lab_chroma (switch to lab_residual to see hue direction).

Title: Karl
Author: Sally Freeman
Entry: 01_027 (01_027_SerialPDI1_2425.jpg)
  LAB result: PASS_WITH_QUERY (toned) via lab [review]
  Notes: Hue variation covers about 18.0°; the tint wanders but stays related. Bright regions reach chroma 33.84 and the 99th percentile sits near 16.49, which looks strongly coloured. Around 33.3% of pixels sit beyond C*2 and 23.2% exceed C*4, so the cast touches a noticeable portion of the frame. Largest C*4 cluster covers 23.2% of the frame. Hue stays consistent from shadows to highlights.
  Tones: dominant tone ≈ purple; other tones: magenta, blue, aqua
  Reason: Borderline toned image dominated by purple; hue variation is close to the review threshold. Overall tint is present but still subtle. Multiple hue clusters detected—confirm the toning is intentional. Large neutral-shadow region (~66.5%) with a single-hue subject—review lighting intent.
  Lightroom tip: Press B&W to compare; if the frame barely shifts, the tint is subtle but measurable. Raise the global Saturation to +40 and return to zero while watching the purple areas for a gentle swing. Leave it if you like the tone—it's flagged only for review. Overlay hint: lab_chroma (switch to lab_residual to see hue direction).

Title: An Enigmatic Series
Author: Gerry Metcalfe
Entry: 01_000 (01_000_SerialPDI1_2425.jpg)
  LAB result: PASS (neutral) via lab
  Notes: Hue variation stays tight (≈0.0°), consistent with a single tint. Bright regions reach chroma 2.24 and the 99th percentile sits near 0.00, which looks barely above neutral. Only trace pixels (under 0.5%) creep past the C*2 threshold.

Title: See The Truth
Author: Debra Bennett
Entry: 01_002 (01_002_SerialPDI1_2425.jpg)
  LAB result: PASS (toned) via lab [review]
  Notes: Hue variation spans about 109.7°, so multiple colour families are in play. Bright regions reach chroma 8.60 and the 99th percentile sits near 4.24, which looks clearly coloured. Around 16.6% of pixels sit beyond C*2 and 1.7% exceed C*4, so the cast touches a noticeable portion of the frame. Largest C*4 cluster covers 1.7% of the frame. Hue flips by roughly 279.9° through the tonal range, a strong split-tone signature.
  Tones: dominant tone ≈ aqua; other tones: aqua, magenta, green
  Reason: Toned monochrome with a dominant aqua tint; hue variation is narrow but stronger than the standard toned limit. Overall tint is present but still subtle. Multiple hue clusters detected—confirm the toning is intentional. Hue flips between hue families across the tonal range.
