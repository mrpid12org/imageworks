  "description": "In the image, residual color is observed in the storefront of the Dental Clinic. The glass windows have a subtle aqua tint, which is close to the review threshold for color detection. This aqua tone is detected across multiple color areas, indicating that the toning is intentional and not a result of noise or artifacts. The hue variation is wider than typical for a pure single tone, suggesting that the aqua tint is not a uniform color but rather a gradient or a blend of colors.",
