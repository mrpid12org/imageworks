### QUERY (2)

**01_006**
- Title: Zebra
- Author: Ken Bingham
- File: 01_006_SerialPDI1_2526.jpg
  - LAB result: PASS_WITH_QUERY (toned) via lab [review]
  - Tones: dominant tone ≈ green; other tones: green, aqua, red
  - Description: Colors vary slightly but remain harmonious. The brightest areas show strongly colored tinting. Roughly 8.9% of the frame shows some color tinting. Colors remain consistent from shadows to highlights. Image has green toning that's close to the review threshold. Multiple color areas detected—confirm the toning is intentional.
  - Lightroom tip: Press B&W to compare; if the frame barely shifts, the tint is subtle but measurable. Raise the global Saturation to +40 and return to zero while watching the green areas for a gentle swing. Leave it if you like the tone—it's flagged only for review. Overlay hint: lab_chroma (switch to lab_residual to see hue direction).

**01_008**
- Title: And now I've got toothache
- Author: Brian Cockley
- File: 01_008_SerialPDI1_2526.jpg
  - LAB result: PASS_WITH_QUERY (toned) via lab [review]
  - Tones: dominant tone ≈ aqua; other tones: aqua, blue, orange
  - Description: Multiple color families are present in the image. The brightest areas show strongly colored tinting. Around 15.6% of the image contains noticeable color. Colors change dramatically from shadows to highlights. Image has aqua toning that's close to the review threshold. Multiple color areas detected—confirm the toning is intentional. ICC profile missing; assumed sRGB. Toning collapsed to a single hue family across highlights and shadows. Hue variation is wider than typical for a pure single tone.
  - Lightroom tip: Press B&W to compare; if the frame barely shifts, the tint is subtle but measurable. Use Color Grading to drop Shadow and Highlight saturation to zero and back—the opposing hues reveal the split tone. Leave it if you like the tone—it's flagged only for review. Overlay hint: lab_residual (add lab_chroma to gauge intensity).
