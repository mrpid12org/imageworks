### QUERY (2)

**01_006**
- Title: Zebra
- Author: Ken Bingham
- File: 01_006_SerialPDI1_2526.jpg
  - LAB result: PASS_WITH_QUERY (toned) via lab [review]
  - Tones: dominant tone ≈ green; other tones: green, aqua, red
  - Description: Hue variation covers about 14.6°; the tint wanders but stays related. Bright regions reach chroma 11.05 and the 99th percentile sits near 7.07, which looks strongly coloured. Roughly 8.9% of the frame carries a mild tint (C*2) and 4.9% pushes into stronger colour. Largest C*4 cluster covers 4.9% of the frame. Hue stays consistent from shadows to highlights. Two-peak analysis shows Δh=59.6° with secondary mass=1.0%. Highlights and shadows hues are close (Δh=11.8°), indicating a drifted single tone. Borderline toned image dominated by green; hue variation is close to the review threshold. Overall tint is essentially nil. Multiple hue clusters detected—confirm the toning is intentional. Highlights and shadows hues are close (Δh=11.8°), indicating a drifted single tone.
  - Lightroom tip: Press B&W to compare; if the frame barely shifts, the tint is subtle but measurable. Raise the global Saturation to +40 and return to zero while watching the green areas for a gentle swing. Leave it if you like the tone—it's flagged only for review. Overlay hint: lab_chroma (switch to lab_residual to see hue direction).

**01_008**
- Title: And now I've got toothache
- Author: Brian Cockley
- File: 01_008_SerialPDI1_2526.jpg
  - LAB result: PASS_WITH_QUERY (toned) via lab [review]
  - Tones: dominant tone ≈ aqua; other tones: aqua, blue, orange
  - Description: Hue variation spans about 88.7°, so multiple colour families are in play. Bright regions reach chroma 22.47 and the 99th percentile sits near 7.28, which looks strongly coloured. Around 15.6% of pixels sit beyond C*2 and 4.6% exceed C*4, so the cast touches a noticeable portion of the frame. Largest C*4 cluster covers 4.5% of the frame. Hue flips by roughly -166.8° through the tonal range, a strong split-tone signature. Two-peak analysis shows Δh=43.4° with secondary mass=26.0%. Highlights and shadows hues are close (Δh=13.4°), indicating a drifted single tone. Borderline toned image dominated by aqua; hue variation is close to the review threshold. Overall tint is essentially nil. Multiple hue clusters detected—confirm the toning is intentional. Hue flips between hue families across the tonal range. Highlights and shadows hues are close (Δh=13.4°), indicating a drifted single tone. ICC profile missing; assumed sRGB. Toning collapsed to a single hue family across highlights and shadows. Hue variation is wider than typical for a pure single tone.
  - Lightroom tip: Press B&W to compare; if the frame barely shifts, the tint is subtle but measurable. Use Color Grading to drop Shadow and Highlight saturation to zero and back—the opposing hues reveal the split tone. Leave it if you like the tone—it's flagged only for review. Overlay hint: lab_residual (add lab_chroma to gauge intensity).

- File: 01_085_SerialPDI1_2526.jpg
  - LAB result: PASS (toned) via lab [review]
  - Tones: dominant tone ≈ aqua; other tones: aqua, red, aqua
  - Description: Hue variation spans about 110.6°, so multiple colour families are in play. Bright regions reach chroma 7.21 and the 99th percentile sits near 2.24, which looks a faint but measurable tint. Roughly 4.0% of the frame carries a mild tint (C*2) and 0.1% pushes into stronger colour. Largest C*4 cluster covers 0.1% of the frame. Hue flips by roughly 304.7° through the tonal range, a strong split-tone signature. Two-peak analysis shows Δh=179.5° with secondary mass=33.5%. Highlights and shadows hues are distinct (Δh=175.9°), supporting a split-tone interpretation. Toned monochrome with a dominant aqua tint; hue variation is narrow but stronger than the standard toned limit. Overall tint is essentially nil. Multiple hue clusters detected—confirm the toning is intentional. Hue flips between hue families across the tonal range. Highlights and shadows hues are distinct (Δh=175.9°), supporting a split-tone interpretation.
