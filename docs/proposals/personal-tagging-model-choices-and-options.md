Below is a consolidated, detailed plan for your caption → keyword-tag → full-description app, organised by your two hardware envelopes—~16 GB VRAM (RTX 4080) and ~96 GB VRAM (RTX 6000 Pro)—and laddered from simplest/fastest to deploy → highest-quality/most complex. I’ve kept all prior details and woven in short sidebars on boxes vs masks, open-vocabulary localisation, and embeddings (global vs region) where they naturally matter. I close with explicit start-points for each GPU.

A) RTX 4080 (~16 GB) — strong quality under tight VRAM
A1) One VLM, three prompts (caption | tags | description)

What: Stand up a single 7–8B-class VLM; vary the prompt per task.

Good candidates (open, actively maintained):

LLaVA-NeXT-7B – improved reasoning/OCR vs earlier LLaVA; widely used and maintained.

Pros

Fastest to ship—one OpenAI-style endpoint with three prompts.

Good→excellent captions and readable long descriptions out-of-the-box.
LLaVA

Cons

Keywording can drift (hallucinations, inconsistent terms); no native region evidence unless the model exposes grounding.

Use when: You want a production-ready baseline today with minimal ops.

A2) VLM + Embeddings for tagging (deterministic & fast)

What: Keep A1 for captions/descriptions; generate tags with CLIP-family / SigLIP embeddings against a controlled vocabulary (cosine similarity + thresholds).
arXiv
+1

Why this matters: Embedding-based tagging gives scores you can tune, makes QC simple, and is fast/lightweight. SigLIP and EVA-CLIP are strong modern open choices for image–text retrieval.
arXiv
+2
arXiv
+2

Pros

Deterministic tags with confidence; easy dashboards and thresholds.

Small, fast models → negligible VRAM/latency overhead.
Hugging Face

Cons

Limited to your predefined taxonomy (won’t “invent” new terms unless you expand it).

Use when: You need stable, measurable tagging quality.

Sidebar — Embeddings: global vs region.
Store global embeddings (full image) for near-duplicate detection and “more-like-this” search, and region embeddings (from crops) for object-level retrieval (e.g., “find other images with a similar brass stem”). Region embeddings pair naturally with grounding (A3/B3 below). SigLIP/EVA-CLIP work for both.
arXiv
+1

A3) Add open-vocabulary grounding for explainability & recall

What: Extend A2 with Grounding-DINO 1.5 to localise candidate terms (boxes; optionally pass to SAM-2 for masks). Optionally run your VLM on grounded crops to produce dense region captions and then aggregate.
GitHub
+2
arXiv
+2

Why grounding matters: You can prove where each tag/phrase comes from, reduce hallucinations by requiring localisation, and power region-level search. Grounding-DINO 1.5 offers Pro (accuracy) and Edge (speed) variants; both are designed for open-set phrases.
arXiv

Pros

Region evidence (auditable UI overlays); improved long-tail coverage.

Enables “click the phrase → highlight the region” reviewer tools.

Cons

One more component (and thresholds/NMS) to tune.

Sidebar — Boxes vs masks (and when each helps).

Bounding boxes (from Grounding-DINO) are cheap and robust: perfect for evidence overlays, basic analytics, and routing crops to the VLM for region captions.

Segmentation masks (from SAM-2) add pixel-accurate shapes: invaluable when tags depend on precise extents (e.g., “hairline crack along rim”), for area-based statistics, or for object-centric crops that avoid background contamination before feeding back to a VLM. Use boxes by default; escalate to masks where precision matters.

Sidebar — Open-vocabulary localisation (OVD).
OVD systems can localise unbounded category names at inference (not just a fixed label set) by aligning detectors with language–image pretraining (e.g., CLIP/SigLIP). Grounding-DINO 1.5 is a current open reference here, with “Pro” and “Edge” models designed for accuracy vs speed. That’s why OVD is so useful for art objects, materials, styles, and other long-tail terms.
arXiv
+1

B) RTX 6000 Pro (~96 GB) — quality first; you can afford complexity
B1) Bigger single model (quality uplift; minimal change)

What: Swap the 7–8B VLM for a 30–70B generalist (e.g., LLaVA-NeXT 32/34B, Qwen2.5-VL-32B/72B, Cog-family VL 30B) at BF16/FP16. Expect richer detail and more coherent long-form descriptions.
LLaVA
+1

Pros

One model → simple ops; strong uplift in narrative quality/robustness.

No aggressive quantisation.

Cons

Higher per-image latency/cost; still lacks explicit region evidence.

Use when: You want a quality jump without re-architecting.

B2) Two-tier routing: fast lane + heavy lane

What: Keep your 7–8B VLM for throughput; route hard images or final descriptions to the 30–70B. Trigger on heuristics: low tag coverage, high caption entropy, presence of OCR text, etc. This is straightforward to implement with vLLM/LMDeploy multi-deployment patterns; if/when you chase latency, TensorRT-LLM + Triton has a documented multimodal backend.
VLLM Docs
+2
VLLM Docs
+2

Pros

Best cost/perf curve: heavy model only where it pays off.

Keeps the system responsive under batch loads.

Cons

You’ll maintain routing rules and two model images.

B3) Full curation stack: VLM + Embeddings + Grounding (+ dense region captions)

What: Combine B1/B2 with the A3 tagger. Use Grounding-DINO to localise your taxonomy terms; (optionally) refine with SAM-2 masks; then pass the grounded crops to your VLM to produce dense region captions; finally assemble a polished wall-label description (optionally run through a small text-only LLM via vLLM to enforce strict JSON/XMP schema).

Pros

Highest trust: tags/phrases are grounded; region thumbnails in UI.

Best retrieval: store global + region embeddings, enabling “find more like this part.”
arXiv
+1

Cons

Most moving parts; more thresholds/deduping/aggregation to tune.

Highest per-image latency (your 96 GB hides a lot of this).

Sidebar — Dense captioning, revisited (how we emulate it).
Classic DenseCap predicted many (region, caption) pairs in one shot. Today, a pragmatic way to get the same effect is ground first (proposals via open-vocab detection) then caption crops with your VLM. You keep dense, explainable annotations without committing to a specialised dense-cap architecture.

Recommended start-points (given your multi-model backend)
✅ Start now on 16 GB (RTX 4080)

Caption + Description: Deploy LLaVA-NeXT-7B or Idefics2-8B via vLLM or LMDeploy, quantised to 8-bit (4-bit if you need more headroom). Two prompts:

Caption: concise, one sentence, factual (no opinions).

Why this start: Strong captions + readable descriptions, stable tags, and a clean path to explainability (grounded regions) without blowing the 16 GB budget.

✅ Upgrade on 96 GB (RTX 6000 Pro)

Two-tier routing: Keep the 7–8B fast lane; add a 30–70B VLM (e.g., LLaVA-NeXT-32/34B or Qwen2.5-VL-32B/72B) at BF16/FP16 for final descriptions and tricky images. Route ~10–30% upward based on heuristics (low tag coverage, high entropy, OCR present, etc.).

also what is long tail recall
ChatGPT said:
Thought
“Long-tail recall” — what it means (and why you care)

Short definition.
In an imbalanced (long-tailed) label space—where a few tags are common (“head”) and many are rare (“tail”)—long-tail recall is how many of the ground-truth rare tags your system successfully recovers. Formally, it’s recall computed only over tail classes (or macro-averaged with emphasis on the tail). Long-tailed learning is a well-studied setting in vision/NLP, where standard models tend to overfit the head and under-detect rare categories.
arXiv
+1

Why it matters in your app

In a photo library, the useful metadata often lives in the tail: specific materials (“bakelite”), techniques (“craquelure”), niche objects (“spirit level”), or proper nouns (gallery names, signage strings). A system that nails “dog, tree, sky” but misses “Daguerreotype plate” has high overall accuracy yet poor long-tail utility for search, curation, and competition notes. Improving long-tail recall directly improves retrievability and curatorial trust.

How to measure it (practical)

Define head / body / tail.
Rank tags by frequency on your corpus; split by quantiles (e.g., top 10% = head, next 20% = body, remaining 70% = tail). This is standard in long-tailed evaluation.
arXiv

Choose the metric per task.

Keyword tagging (multi-label):

Tail Recall@k: among all tail ground-truth tags for an image, what fraction appear in the top-k predictions?

Tail mAP / Tail F1: compute mAP/F1 only over tail classes.

Open-vocabulary detection / grounding:

Tail Recall@IoU=t: proportion of tail objects correctly localised above IoU threshold (e.g., 0.5).

Optionally evaluate phrase grounding (REC) for tail phrases.
arXiv

Report side-by-side: overall recall vs tail recall. The gap quantifies how much your pipeline ignores rare concepts even if headline numbers look good.

What typically hurts long-tail recall

Class imbalance & calibration: models over-predict head classes; tail logits are under-calibrated. Remedies include loss re-weighting, logit adjustment, and distribution alignment.
CVF Open Access

Limited tail supervision: very few examples per rare tag; contrastive representation learning helps, but naive cross-entropy often underperforms on tails.
CVF Open Access
+1

Closed vocabularies: classic detectors can’t even name rare categories at inference time.

Concrete ways to raise long-tail recall (and trade-offs)

Open-vocabulary localisation (OVD) in the loop
Use Grounding-DINO (Pro/Edge) to localise text queries drawn from your taxonomy (and synonyms). Because it’s trained to align language and regions, it can recognise unseen categories at test time—exactly what the tail needs.
Trade-off: extra latency (one query per candidate term) and thresholds to tune; but you gain explainable boxes (or masks) and better tail coverage.
GitHub
+1

Sidebar — Boxes vs Masks.
Start with boxes (cheap, robust evidence). Add masks via SAM-2 only when pixel-precise extents matter (e.g., hairline crack area or shape-driven comparisons). Masks improve region-level embedding quality but cost extra compute.
CVF Open Access

Embeddings for controlled tagging (global + region)

Compute global embeddings (whole image) to propose candidate tail tags via cosine similarity.

After grounding a phrase, compute region embeddings (cropped object) to confirm the match and to power “find more like this part”. Modern encoders such as CLIP and SigLIP are strong here.
Trade-off: you must maintain a taxonomy + synonym list; in return you get tunable thresholds and much more stable tail behaviour.
arXiv
+2
CVF Open Access
+2

Contrastive / re-balanced training tricks (if you fine-tune)

Supervised contrastive objectives and distribution-aware calibration (e.g., “distribution alignment”, re-weighting, logit adjustment) are proven to lift tail classes.
Trade-off: engineering/training time; but effects on tails can be substantial.
CVF Open Access
+2
CVF Open Access
+2

Prompt routing to a stronger VLM on hard cases
If the fast 7–8B model misses or hedges (low confidence), route to a larger 30–70B VLM which tends to describe rare attributes more reliably.
Trade-off: latency and cost—use selective routing so you only pay for the tail. (This is why we proposed a two-tier design.)

Active learning on tail errors
Surface low-confidence tail candidates (with their grounded region thumbnails) to a human for one-click confirm/correct; fold corrections back into synonym tables or lightweight adapters.
Trade-off: some UI + ops, but it compounds recall gains over time and keeps taxonomy tidy.

How this connects to your pipeline choices

VLM-only (one model, three prompts) is fast to ship but tends to have lower tail recall for niche tags (no grounding, weaker calibration).

Adding Embeddings + OVD grounding typically gives the biggest lift in long-tail recall because you (a) can name rare things (open-vocab), (b) can localise them (evidence), and (c) can tune thresholds per tag or per group.

Up-routing to a larger VLM improves the language description of rare attributes, but for tagging the combination of grounding + embeddings is usually more impactful on tail recall than prose alone.
