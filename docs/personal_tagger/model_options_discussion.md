Below is a **consolidated, detailed report** of options and recommendations for your image-library app (caption → keywords → full description). I’ve organised it by your two hardware envelopes—**~16 GB VRAM (RTX 4080)** and **~96 GB VRAM (RTX 6000 Pro)**—and laddered choices from **simplest/fastest to deploy** → **highest-quality/most complex**. I’ve also included short breakout notes explaining **why dense captioning, grounding, and fine-tunes** matter, plus clear pros/cons and concrete model/server pointers. Citations highlight the most load-bearing claims or docs.

---

# A) RTX 4080 (~16 GB) — you want strong quality under tight VRAM

## A1) One VLM, three prompts (caption | tags | description)

**What:** Stand up a single, 7–8B-class VLM and vary the prompt per task.
**Good candidates:**

* **LLaVA-NeXT-7B** — widely used, improved OCR/reasoning vs earlier LLaVA, strong community support. ([LLaVA][1])
* **Idefics2-8B** — general-purpose, particularly good on OCR/doc/chart and multi-image sequences; excellent HF integration. ([Hugging Face][2])
* **Qwen2.5-VL-7B** — precise object naming, structured outputs, sizes 3B/7B/72B. ([Qwen][3])

**Serving:** **vLLM** (multimodal examples + supported models list) or **LMDeploy** (Qwen-VL quickstarts); quantize to 8- or 4-bit to fit comfortably and leave headroom for batches. ([VLLM Docs][4])

**Pros**

* Fastest to ship (one OpenAI-style endpoint, three prompts).
* Good→excellent captions and long descriptions out-of-the-box. ([LLaVA][1])
* Well-documented inference stacks (vLLM multimodal; LMDeploy MLLM pages). ([VLLM Docs][5])

**Cons**

* Keywording can **drift** (hallucinations, inconsistent phrasing).
* No explicit region evidence unless the model exposes grounding APIs.

**Best for:** You want a working system **today** with minimal ops, and you’ll tolerate some tag noise.

---

## A2) VLM + Embeddings for tagging (deterministic, fast)

**What:** Keep A1 for captions/descriptions; do tagging with **CLIP-family/SigLIP** embeddings against a **controlled vocabulary** (cosine similarity + thresholds). ([arXiv][6])

**Why this matters:** Embedding-based tagging gives you **scores you can tune**, great speed, and **stable terminology** aligned with your taxonomy—ideal for libraries and QC. SigLIP/EVA-CLIP variants are strong open choices. ([arXiv][7])

**Pros**

* Deterministic, debuggable tags with confidence thresholds.
* Very small/fast models → negligible extra VRAM/latency.

**Cons**

* Limited to your predefined tag list (you won’t “invent” new tags without updating it).

**Best for:** Stable, measurable tagging quality with easy dashboards.

---

## A3) Add **open-vocabulary grounding** for explainability & recall

**What:** A2 + **Grounding-DINO 1.5** to *localize* candidate terms (boxes; optional masks via **SAM-2**). Optional: pass grounded crops back to your VLM for **dense region captions**; aggregate to whole-image caption/description. ([arXiv][8])

**Why grounding matters:** Grounding links each keyword/phrase to an **exact region**. That gives **auditability** (“show me where ‘brass stem’ is”) and improves curator trust. Grounding-DINO 1.5 (Pro & Edge) is designed for **open-set** queries—great for long-tail art/object terms. ([arXiv][8])

**Pros**

* **Region evidence** for each tag; better long-tail recall.
* Enables UI overlays and region-level search.

**Cons**

* One more component to host; you’ll tune thresholds/NMS and add light plumbing.

**Best for:** Curator-grade tagging and region-aware search, still feasible on ~16 GB with modest batch sizes.

---

# B) RTX 6000 Pro (~96 GB) — quality first; you can afford complexity

## B1) Bigger single model (quality uplift, minimal change)

**What:** Replace the 7–8B with a **30–70B** generalist VLM (e.g., **LLaVA-NeXT-32/34B**, **Qwen2.5-VL-32B/72B**, **CogVLM2-Llama3-30B**) at BF16/FP16. Expect richer detail & more coherent long-form descriptions. ([GitHub][9])

**Pros**

* One model → simple ops; strong uplift in narrative detail/robustness.
* No aggressive quantization needed.

**Cons**

* Higher per-image latency/cost; still no region evidence by itself.

**Best for:** A quick “quality jump” without re-architecting your pipeline.

---

## B2) Two-tier routing: **fast lane + heavy lane**

**What:** Keep the **7–8B** for throughput; route **hard images** or **final descriptions** to a **30–70B** model. Trigger on heuristics (low tag coverage/entropy/uncertainty) or a confidence metric from the tagger. vLLM and LMDeploy both support multi-deployment patterns; TRT-LLM/Triton helps when you push for low latency at scale. ([VLLM Docs][4])

**Pros**

* Throughput where it matters; **quality uplift on a subset** only.
* Smooth cost/perf curve; keeps the farm responsive.

**Cons**

* You’ll maintain routing logic and two model images.

**Best for:** Scale + quality without moving every request to a large model.

---

## B3) **Full curation stack:** VLM + Embeddings + Grounding (+ dense region captions)

**What:** Combine **B1/B2** with the **A3** tagger. Add **dense region captions** (VLM over grounded boxes) to generate curator-friendly notes per region; assemble into a polished, wall-label description via the **big VLM**. Optionally bring in **Florence-2** where you want a **unified promptable model** (captioning, grounding, segmentation in one). ([Microsoft][10])

**Pros**

* Highest trust: every important tag/phrase is **grounded**; region thumbnails in UI.
* Best retrieval: store **global + region** embeddings (SigLIP/EVA-CLIP) to power “find more like this region.” ([Hugging Face][11])

**Cons**

* Most moving parts; more tuning (thresholds, deduping, aggregation).
* Highest latency per image—your 96 GB card hides a lot of that.

**Best for:** Production curation, competition-ready descriptions, and **explainable** tagging.

---

# Breakout explanations (why these pieces matter)

## Dense captioning (many small captions per image)

Dense captioning generalises detection + description: the model proposes **multiple regions** and emits short, factual snippets (e.g., “red ceramic bowl”, “folded linen napkin”). For libraries, this yields **fine-grained, explainable annotations**—vital for search facets and curator review. In practice, you can proxy dense captions by (i) open-vocabulary **grounding** to define regions and (ii) running your VLM over those crops. This keeps feature parity without committing to a specialised dense-cap model.

## Visual grounding (phrase→region)

Grounding answers *“where is the thing the text refers to?”* For tagging, it (1) **reduces hallucination** (we only accept tags that localise), (2) gives **UI evidence** (boxes/masks), and (3) enables **region-level search**. **Grounding-DINO 1.5** offers open-vocabulary localisation (Pro = accuracy; Edge = speed), and **SAM-2** can turn boxes into **precise masks** if your UI or analytics benefit from segmentation. ([arXiv][8])

## Specialist caption fine-tunes vs generalist VLMs

Fine-tuned captioners (BLIP-style, GIT, small LLM heads) can be **very consistent** on single-sentence captions and lighter to host—but they’re narrower and don’t give you the **multi-task flexibility** (keywording, long descriptions, instruction-following) you get from a generalist VLM. In practice, most teams:

* start with a **generalist VLM** (breadth), then
* add **grounding + embeddings** for robust tags, and
* optionally fine-tune for **tone/style** once they have in-domain images.
  This keeps your system adaptable as your library broadens.

# Serving & tooling notes you can rely on

* **vLLM** — supports multimodal inputs and lists vision models in “Supported Models”; examples show how to pass images and use correct prompts. **vLLM-V1** also focused on multimodal performance/latency. ([VLLM Docs][12])
* **LMDeploy** — has step-by-step guides for **Qwen-VL/Qwen2-VL** online/offline serving and a maintained supported-models matrix including **Qwen2.5-VL**. ([lmdeploy.readthedocs.io][13])
* **TensorRT-LLM/Triton** — release notes/support matrix explicitly add **Llama 3.2-Vision**, with end-to-end multimodal backend docs for production serving. Good path when you optimise latency on the 96 GB card. ([nvidia.github.io][14])

# Concrete model picks (open, active, and well-documented)

* **General VLMs:** **LLaVA-NeXT** (improved OCR/reasoning), **Idefics2-8B** (OCR/docs/multi-image), **Qwen2.5-VL** (sizes 3B/7B/72B; strong structure). ([LLaVA][1])
* **Unified promptable VLM:** **Florence-2** (captioning, grounding, detection, segmentation in a single model family). ([Microsoft][10])
* **Open-vocabulary localisation:** **Grounding-DINO 1.5** (Pro/Edge; docs + arXiv), **SAM-2** (precise masks, fast). ([arXiv][8])
* **Embeddings (retrieval & tag scoring):** **SigLIP / SigLIP-2** (multilingual variants), **EVA-CLIP** (SOTA-ish open CLIP line). ([arXiv][6])

---

# My recommended starting points (given your multi-model backend)

## ✅ Start now on **16 GB (RTX 4080)**

1. **Caption + Description:** deploy **LLaVA-NeXT-7B** *or* **Idefics2-8B** via **vLLM** or **LMDeploy**; quantize to **8-bit** (or 4-bit if you need room for batches). Use two prompts:

   * *Caption*: concise, 1 sentence, no opinions.
   * *Description*: curator tone, 60–120 words, mention subject/lighting/color/composition, avoid speculation.
     (Both models are well-documented and run cleanly in these servers.) ([VLLM Docs][4])
2. **Tags:** add **SigLIP** embeddings over your taxonomy; return `{tag, score}` and set thresholds (e.g., top-k + min-score). If coverage < target, append a **VLM-suggested** tag list with a “needs-review” flag. ([Hugging Face][11])
3. **(Optional next) Grounding:** slot in **Grounding-DINO 1.5 Edge** to localise your high-scoring tags; keep the boxes/masks in `regions.json` so reviewers can see evidence overlays. ([arXiv][8])

**Why this start:** You get strong captions and readable descriptions immediately, **deterministic** tags for library reliability, and a clean path to **explainability** (A3) when you’re ready.

---

## ✅ Upgrade on **96 GB (RTX 6000 Pro)**

1. **Two-tier routing:** keep the 7–8B fast lane; add a **30–70B** VLM (e.g., **LLaVA-NeXT-32/34B** or **Qwen2.5-VL-32B/72B**) at BF16/FP16 for **final descriptions** and **hard images**. Use routing rules (e.g., short/uncertain descriptions, low tag coverage, OCR present) to send ~10–30% upward. ([GitHub][9])
2. **Full curation stack:** turn on **Grounding-DINO 1.5 (Pro)** + **SAM-2** for region evidence and long-tail recall; generate **dense region captions** by passing grounded boxes back to the VLM; aggregate into a polished, wall-label description (optionally with a small **text-only LLM** via **vLLM** to enforce your JSON/XMP schema). ([arXiv][8])
3. **(Optional)** Explore **Florence-2** where a **unified promptable** model (caption/ground/segment) simplifies maintenance for certain pipelines, while you keep the bigger VLM for best-quality prose. ([Microsoft][10])

**Why this upgrade:** You achieve **curator-grade** descriptions, **auditable** tags with regions, and keep throughput high by routing only the tricky cases to the heavy model.

---

## Practical VRAM notes (rule-of-thumb)

* **7–8B VLMs** (image understanding, 1–2 MP inputs): typically workable on ~16 GB with **8-bit** (or **4-bit**) quantisation.
* **30–70B VLMs**: run comfortably on ~96 GB at BF16/FP16; consider **TRT-LLM + Triton** when you need low-latency/throughput at scale; vLLM also documents multimodal usage patterns. ([nvidia.github.io][14])
