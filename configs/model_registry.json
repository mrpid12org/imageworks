When it comes to the open character, we took inspiration from open source permissive licenses regarding the grant of IP rights. Referring to the downstream responsible use, we added use-based restrictions not permitting the use of the model in very specific scenarios, in order for the licensor to be able to enforce the license in case potential misuses of the Model may occur. At the same time, we strive to promote open and responsible research on generative models for content generation.\n\nEven though downstream derivative versions of the model could be released under different licensing terms, the latter will always have to include - at minimum - the same use-based restrictions as the ones in the original license (this license). We believe in the intersection between open and responsible AI development; thus, this agreement aims to strike a balance between both in order to enable responsible open-science in the field of AI.\n\nThis License governs the use of the model (and its derivatives) and is informed by the model card associated with the model.\n\nNOW THEREFORE, You and DeepSeek agree as follows:\n\n1. Definitions\n   \"License\" means the terms and conditions for use, reproduction, and Distribution as defined in this document.\n   \"Data\" means a collection of information and/or content extracted from the dataset used with the Model, including to train, pretrain, or otherwise evaluate the Model. The Data is not licensed under this License.\n   \"Output\" means the results of operating a Model as embodied in informational content resulting therefrom.\n   \"Model\" means any accompanying machine-learning based assemblies (including checkpoints), consisting of learnt weights, parameters (including optimizer states), corresponding to the model architecture as embodied in the Complementary Material, that have been trained or tuned, in whole or in part on the Data, using the Complementary Material.\n   \"Derivatives of the Model\" means all modifications to the Model, works based on the Model, or any other model which is created or initialized by transfer of patterns of the weights, parameters, activations or output of the Model, to the other model, in order to cause the other model to perform similarly to the Model, including - but not limited to - distillation methods entailing the use of intermediate data representations or methods based on the generation of synthetic data by the Model for training the other model.\n   \"Complementary Material\" means the accompanying source code and scripts used to define, run, load, benchmark or evaluate the Model, and used to prepare data for training or evaluation, if any. This includes any accompanying documentation, tutorials, examples, etc, if any.\n   \"Distribution\" means any transmission, reproduction, publication or other sharing of the Model or Derivatives of the Model to a third party, including providing the Model as a hosted service made available by electronic or other remote means - e.g. API-based or web access.\n   \"DeepSeek\" (or \"we\") means Beijing DeepSeek Artificial Intelligence Fundamental Technology Research Co., Ltd., Hangzhou DeepSeek Artificial Intelligence Fundamental Technology Research Co., Ltd. and/or any of their affiliates.\n   \"You\" (or \"Your\") means an individual or Legal Entity exercising permissions granted by this License and/or making use of the Model for whichever purpose and in any field of use, including usage of the Model in an end-use application - e.g. chatbot, translator, etc.\n   \"Third Parties\" means individuals or legal entities that are not under common control with DeepSeek or You.\n\nSection II: INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS\n\nBoth copyright and patent grants apply to the Model, Derivatives of the Model and Complementary Material. The Model and Derivatives of the Model are subject to additional terms as described in Section III.\n\n2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, DeepSeek hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Complementary Material, the Model, and Derivatives of the Model.\n\n3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License and where and as applicable, DeepSeek hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this paragraph) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Model and the Complementary Material, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by DeepSeek that are necessarily infringed by its contribution(s). If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Model and/or Complementary Material constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for the Model and/or works shall terminate as of the date such litigation is asserted or filed.\n\nSection III: CONDITIONS OF USAGE, DISTRIBUTION AND REDISTRIBUTION\n\n4. Distribution and Redistribution.
